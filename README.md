# How does this work?
It takes the phone number which is should be same as Cowin Website.⋅⋅
That same number sim card needs to be installed on your phone as well⋅⋅
It will try to auto login as soon as session expires by reading OTP from SMS⋅⋅


# Data Security

This app uses the Cowin APIs directly. There is no backend server or anything,
where your data or phone number will be pushed into. In fact we do not use any sort
of off the shelf analytical software as well. It is purely a Cowin client.
